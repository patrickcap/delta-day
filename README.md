Delta Day encourages personal improvement by making small incremental progress towards things you are interested in, each and every day. Having a focus on small incremements reduces the chances of wasting time thinking too far into the future about large, grand plans, and instead shifts your focus into just starting and doing something. Whilst this can lead to occasionally finding dead-ends, it generally results in greater personal improvement in the long-run compared to doing nothing and trying to plan too far into the future.

Delta Day also focuses on rewarding small efforts, frequently, as opposed to rewarding large efforts, rarely. The application also revokes any shortcuts to share your efforts to social media, this is a journey with respect to you and only you - there is no need for comparison with others.

# Getting Started

To run the application, navigate to the root directory and run the command `python -m src.main`.
